🚀 The One Where Data Meets F.R.I.E.N.D.S 📊
Could I be any more excited about this dashboard? 😃
As a Friends fan and a data enthusiast, I decided to analyze all 236 episodes using Tableau—Because data and nostalgia make a great combo! 🧑‍💻📊
This project explores:
🎥 Directors: Season-wise contributions
📅 Episodes by Season: Episode count trends
⭐ Total Stars per Episode: Key actors' appearances
👍 Audience Votes: Fan favorite episodes

Here’s what I uncovered:
📌 Which seasons had the highest-rated episodes? (Spoiler: Season 5 was 🔥)
📌 How did audience votes fluctuate across seasons?
📌 Which director contributed the most iconic moments? (David Schwimmer directed too? Who knew!)
🎥 Directors: Season-wise contributions
📅 Episodes by Season: Episode count trends
⭐ Total Stars per Episode: Key actors' appearances
👍 Audience Votes: Fan favorite episodes

👀🤪The One Where Everybody Finds Out (S5E14) hit a massive 9.7/10 rating—not shocking, right? 😉

Now tell me, what’s YOUR all-time favorite episode? Let’s geek out over data and nostalgia.
